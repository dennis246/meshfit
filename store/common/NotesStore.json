Fetch is the modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest : unlike XMLHttpRequest , which uses callbacks, Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the modern web such as service workers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

You pass it a Request object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request. The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing the server's response.
